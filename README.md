# Face Detection & Expression Recognition App

This project is a React-based web application that uses `face-api.js` to:
- Detect faces from webcam in real-time
- Draw bounding boxes around each face
- Recognize facial expressions and display the top expression with confidence
- Dynamically update background color based on the top expression
- Allow toggling detection and expression recognition
- Show the count of detected faces
